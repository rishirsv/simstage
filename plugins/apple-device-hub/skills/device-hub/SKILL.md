# Apple Device Hub

The user watches the device in the Apple Device Hub viewer while you work: live video, plus the same element list you get. They can touch the screen themselves at any time. You see what the tools return: a numbered list of on-screen elements with tap points and sizes, and a screenshot sized in logical points when you need one.

## Connect

1. Call `open_device_hub` when the user wants to watch or hasn't opened the viewer.
2. Call `device_hub_status`. It lists:
   - sessions on this server, which you can reuse by session ID;
   - devices open in another Device Hub chat or window;
   - running devices, shut-down simulators and physical devices.
3. Call `device_connect` with a device `id`:
   - It boots a stopped simulator.
   - If this server already has a session for the device, it returns that one.
   - If another chat or window holds the device, it joins and shares that session.
   The viewer switches to the device you connect, and its result says how the session was obtained.
4. Keep the session ID for every later call.

Choosing a device:

- Use the device the user names. A running simulator may be one they are using themselves, so say before you drive it.
- To test without touching the user's simulators, call `simulator_create` with a `deviceType` such as `"iPhone 17 Pro"`. It boots the new simulator and returns its session; an unknown type lists the choices. `cloneFrom` copies a shut-down simulator with its apps and data. When you're finished, delete the simulator with `simulator_delete`, which refuses any simulator Device Hub didn't create.
- If `device_connect` says another tool's Xcode session holds the device, ask the user before passing `takeOver: true`. Both tools can then drive it, and Device Hub never ends the other tool's session.

## Observe, act, observe

Simulators use the `simulator_*` tools:

- `simulator_get_state` returns the numbered elements and a `snapshot` number. `simulator_screenshot` returns only an image.
- `simulator_click` takes a `target`: an element number (`12`) or ref (`"e12"`) with the `snapshot`, a selector such as `{"label": "General", "role": "Button"}`, or a point `[x, y]`. `clickCount: 2` double-taps; `duration` long-presses.
- `simulator_type_text` types literal text, focusing `target` first if given. `simulator_press_key` sends Return, Tab, Backspace, Home, Lock, VolumeUp or VolumeDown.
- `simulator_scroll` moves content in `direction` ("down" reveals what is below), optionally within an element. `simulator_drag` swipes between two points.

Physical devices use `device_capture` and `device_action`, for example `{"type": "tap", "element": {"ref": "e6"}}`. On any device, `device_action` also launches an app by bundle ID (`{"type": "launchApp", "bundleId": "com.apple.Maps"}`), opens Settings, rotates, and presses hardware buttons.

- Every input returns the screen after animations settle, with fresh elements. Read it before the next step instead of chaining inputs blind.
- Prefer elements to coordinates. Coordinates are logical points; in the default screenshot one pixel is one point.
- "Accessibility snapshot is stale" means the screen changed, possibly because the user touched it. Observe again and choose the target from the new list. Never guess a replacement.

## Screenshots

Results are text-first. With the default `screenshot: "auto"`, the element list describes the screen, and an image is attached only when the list can't, such as in games, maps, web content, or an empty or hidden list. Every observing and acting tool accepts:

- `"always"` when the answer is visual: layout, clipping, overlap, color, images, or confirming that something looks right.
- `"never"` to keep context small during a long scripted flow you are verifying through elements.

If the elements don't explain what you expected to find, take one screenshot rather than guessing.

The viewer's **Attach screen to your next message** button captures a fresh screenshot,
accessibility hierarchy, target elements, app identity, snapshot and coordinate sizes
as one context attachment. It includes accessibility context even when the viewer's
accessibility display is off, without changing that preference. Element refs describe
that captured snapshot; observe again before acting if the screen has changed.
A saved PNG contains only the image; use Attach screen to pass context into chat.

## Settings

`device_settings` changes `appearance` (light or dark), `textSize`, `reduceMotion`, `reduceTransparency` and `increasedContrast`. Changes persist on the device. Note the original values from a capture's `settings` first, and restore them when you are done.

## Working alongside the user

- Say briefly what you are about to do; the user sees each step happen.
- Ask before actions that are hard to undo or act for the user: deleting data, purchases, sending messages, changing accounts. Hand sign-in, two-factor codes and system permission prompts to the user.
- Input only reaches the device, never the Mac desktop.
- Call `device_disconnect` when finished, unless the user is still using the viewer. A chat or window sharing the session keeps it.

## Problems

- "Could not connect to Xcode MCP": ask the user to open Xcode and enable **Settings → Intelligence → Model Context Protocol**.
- "Xcode did not accept the connection" or "did not answer": Xcode may be showing a dialog, such as a request to allow access. Ask the user to check Xcode, then retry.
- "The device is still busy" or "did not finish": an earlier request is still running and its input may still land. Wait a moment and observe before repeating anything.
- "The device may still be starting": a simulator is booting. Observe again in a few seconds.
- A physical device that will not connect must be paired, unlocked and in Developer Mode; Apple decides eligibility when connecting.
- "Device session expired": the session ended, for example because another tool or an Xcode restart closed it. Connect again with `device_connect`.
